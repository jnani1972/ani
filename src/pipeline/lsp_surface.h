/*
 * lsp_surface.h — per-file LSP-surface codec (closure-repair incremental).
 *
 * A file's SURFACE is everything another file's resolution can consume from
 * it: the ANILSPDefs pass_lsp_cross registers into the cross registries,
 * plus the registry-only symbols (labels the name registry serves that
 * pxc_map_label drops — Field, today). Serialized to canonical JSON, hashed,
 * and persisted per file (store: lsp_surface rows) at publication, so an
 * incremental run can (a) detect that an edit left a file's surface
 * unchanged — a body edit — and skip recomputing its dependents, and
 * (b) rehydrate the cross registries for files it does not re-parse.
 *
 * The JSON is a versioned object {"v":1,"lsp":[...],"reg":[...]}. Field
 * order and array order are fixed by the writer, so byte equality of the
 * serialization is surface equality; the sha256 of these bytes is the
 * stored surface_sha. Rows written by a different codec version fail the
 * "v" check on load and route the run to a full rebuild.
